## *Heart of Flesh — The Visible Architecture of Emotion*

by **Hidemune Tanaka**

---

### 🌌 Overview

**EmotionCube / Heart of Flesh** is an experimental screen saver designed to **visualize the “heart of flesh”** — the living, resonant center of human emotion.

It is not merely a visual effect, but a **philosophical simulator** at the intersection of emotion, language, neuroscience, and theology.

> “I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.”
> — *Ezekiel 36:26*

## 🧩 Structural Concept

### 1. Three-Dimensional Emotional Space

Each emotion is represented as a **three-axis vector (x, y, z)** defined in `emotion.csv`.

| Axis   | Conceptual Meaning    | Interpretation                                    |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| X-axis | Love ↔ Guilt          | The vibration between empathy and self-reflection |
| Y-axis | Pride ↔ Awe           | The tension between power and humility            |
| Z-axis | Near ↔ Distant (Self) | The perception of inner versus external self      |

This tri-axial model extends beyond Plutchik’s emotion wheel or Russell’s circumplex model.
It reconstructs emotion as a **geometry of consciousness**.

### 2. Emotion Particles and Light

Each point rendered by `draw_points()` represents an **emotion particle**.
The RGB color of each point is derived directly from its coordinates — turning numeric emotion vectors into visible wavelengths of light.

* Motion = emotional resonance
* Light = awareness
* Rotation = living dynamism

> Light becomes the visible pulse of empathy —
> the oscillation between self and other.

### 3. The Octahedral Structure of Emotion

Sixteen labeled emotions are placed at balanced coordinates:

```
Joy, Trust, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, Anticipation,
Anger, Surprise, Optimism, Submission,
Contempt, Disapproval, Aggressiveness, Awe, Remorse, Love
```

This is a 3D expansion of **Plutchik’s emotion wheel**, representing the geometric tension between opposites.
The continuous rotation of the structure symbolizes **the non-static equilibrium of the living heart** — ever in motion, never frozen.

---

### 4. Rotation and Non-Periodicity

The rotation axis `(0.486, 0.726, 0)` intentionally uses **irrational proportions**.
This ensures the visual never repeats exactly — an emblem of **perpetual regeneration**.

> The heart of flesh never completes a perfect cycle.
> Its rhythm is perpetual transformation without decay.

---

### 5. Neuroscientific Background

At the bottom of the display, a theme line appears:

> “Research into the relationship between (The brain’s reward system including the hippocampus and amygdala) and (Language).”

This indicates the work’s neurosemantic focus:
how linguistic symbols correspond to emotional states in the brain’s reward system.
By mapping words to spatial coordinates, EmotionCube acts as a **visual experiment in emotional-linguistic resonance**.

## 🕊️ Theological and Ethical Dimension

At its core, the project embodies the ancient contrast between the **heart of stone** and the **heart of flesh**.

| Heart of Stone          | Heart of Flesh     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Unresponsive, defensive | Resonant, adaptive |
| Law and formality       | Life and empathy   |
| External divinity       | Inner divinity     |
| Separation              | Integration        |

Through its luminous geometry, EmotionCube symbolizes the **reawakening of the “Tree of Life”** within human consciousness —
a reconciliation of knowledge and compassion once separated in Genesis 3:22.

## 💫 Artistic Message

> “--- [ Heart of Flesh ] Sample ---
> Data provided by Hidemune TANAKA”

This inscription is not a signature alone;
it signifies that **human creativity mirrors divine architecture**.
To run this program is to observe, through a screen,
the reflection of one’s own emotional cosmos.

> When your heart moves, the universe rotates with it.
